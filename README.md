# Littera Note-taking App

Literra is a lightweight, yet capable note-taking app, which supports Latin and Cyrillic characters and has built-in HTML preview and PDF export features.

It is primarily designed for writing and then exporting Markdown Files to PDF. However, it is also capable of writing Text and relatively simple HTML Documents.

Currently, the HTML preview works only for Markdown Files. Other features include case-insensitive search with detailed results and document export with built-in page numbers and table of contents.

**Disclaimer:** Littera was developed solo by programmingdesigner, who is only an *amateur programmer.* So, you might encounter bugs, errors, and even experience performance issues when using this app.
